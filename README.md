# nodecliutilapp
**simple node cli app done with tutorial, nice bluepring for other similar app. with tutorial but i understand it completely. nice thing is its all done from scratch, formatting and validating cli args, padding zeros in filenames and all. no unnecessary dependencies. basically it copies and sorts files basing on their date.**
